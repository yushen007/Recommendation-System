Introdution
  Recommender systems are the software tools and methods for discovering suggestions/recommendations for items which is useful to the users. The suggestions are related to the various decision-making process, like what items to buy by user, what movies they watch, what music to  listen or what news to reead. Many recommender systems have been developed for different applications. The main aim of recommender system  is to provide right items to right users. It has the capacity to suggest whether a individual user would prefer an item or not based on  users past history and profile.
  Recommender system emerged as an individualistic research area when researchers begun to focus on different recommendation problems. The aim of generating recommender system is to decrease the information overload by recovering the most relevant information and services from a large amount of data, so that giving individualized services. There are three commonly used recommendation techniques which are content-based filtering, collaborative filtering and hybrid filtering technique. Each recommendation algorithms have their own profits and drawbacks.
  With the development of these recommendation techniques, more and more recommender systems have been performed and many real-world recommender system applications have been generated. The applications of recommender system include recommending news, tour, articles, movies, music, books, documents and involve the areas of e-commerce, e-learning, e-governing and e-business services.
